PROJECT 1: Cloud Continuous Delivery of Microservice (MLOps or Data Engineering Focused)

Goals:

Create a Microservice in Flask or Fast API

Push source code to Github

Configure Build System to Deploy changes

Use IaC (Infrastructure as Code) to deploy code

Use either AWS, Azure, GCP (recommended services include Google App Engine, AWS App Runner or Azure App Services)

Containerization is optional, but recommended



Project Summary:

In this project, I will create a microservice in flask and use AWS to deploy the code. The goal of the microservice is to create a healthy breakfast menu based on user input. Based on certain conditions i.e. If the user is tired, if it's a weekend etc, the service will recommend specific food items that fit the user's needs that day.This microservice provides a healthy breakfast menu and eliminates the need for figuring out what to eat each morning, allowing you to focus on more important decisions for the day ahead. 

The service has a menu of items that the user can input when setting up the application. 

The service will not repeat a breakfast recommendation two days in a row.

The service can be customized to meet the user's needs. 


Technical Design:

- This microservice is built using flask 
- Deployed on AWS App Runner
- Using Github Actions as build system to deploy changes
