PROJECT 1:

Cloud Continuous Delivery of Microservice (MLOps or Data Engineering Focused)

Goals:

Create a Microservice in Flask or Fast API

Push source code to Github

Configure Build System to Deploy changes

Use IaC (Infrastructure as Code) to deploy code

Use either AWS, Azure, GCP (recommended services include Google App Engine, AWS App Runner or Azure App Services)

Containerization is optional, but recommended



Summary:

In this project, I will create a microservice in flask and use AWS to deploy code. The microservice will help create a healthy breakfast menu based on user input. If the user is tired, they will be recommended to have coffee and bagels. The goal of the microservice is to provide nutitous options for a healthy breakfast so that the user doesn't have to think about what they should eat first thing in the morning and can make other decisions that are important tot hem that day. 

The service has a menu of items that the user can input when setting up the application. 

The service will not repeat a breakfast recommendation two days in a row.

The service can be customized to meet the user's needs. 


Technical details:

This microservice is built using flask and deployed on AWS.
